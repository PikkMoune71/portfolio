The aim was to centralise and make accessible a process that is often complex for students, while making recruitment easier for companies. This project gave me the opportunity to apply my front-end and back-end skills, while integrating advanced functionalities to provide a fluid and intuitive user experience",

      "Scrolly is a revolutionary Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to simplify the process of finding and applying for work experience and internship opportunities for students. Currently, this process is often complex and time-consuming, involving navigating multiple platforms and communication channels. On the other hand, companies have difficulty finding candidates who match their specific needs among a multitude of untargeted applications. Scrolly centralises and simplifies this process, offering an intuitive and efficient platform. By digitising and automating certain key stages in the recruitment process, Scrolly aims to become a major player in the field of work-study and placement recruitment, facilitating the connection between students and companies.",

      "Mentor.io is an initiative carried out as part of Ydays at Ynov School, a weekly program dedicated to innovation, creativity, and collaboration, allowing students to work on projects of their choice. These days, organized every Wednesday, give students the opportunity to dedicate themselves to a project throughout the year, collaborating with students from various fields and levels (from Bachelor 1 to Master 2). Students can choose to join an existing project or create their own, with increased responsibility when creating a project, notably the responsibility of forming and motivating an interdisciplinary team. The Mentor.io project fits perfectly within this dynamic as a platform aimed at promoting collaborative learning, mentoring, and the sharing of skills. As the project manager, I led this initiative by forming a team of students from different disciplines to create an innovative solution that has both social and educational impact. The project was carried out under the auspices of Ynov's Change Lab incubator, whose mission is to support projects with an innovative economic model and a social and environmental impact. Mentor.io aims to transform the way individuals learn, connect, and contribute positively to society by connecting people with specific skills to those looking to acquire them. The project ran from October 2023 to June 2024, allowing students to work collaboratively on an innovative platform while integrating evaluation tools and systems to encourage interaction and skill transfer.",
